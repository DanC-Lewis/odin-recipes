    <p center>Hey everyone! It's me, Dan and today I'm here to show you a mediocre website that I just created as part of my studies at The Odin Project. Within these hallowed pages you'll find nothing really useful(except the meatloaf, it's really good)but I hope you enjoy looking at it anyway. Remember to hit that bell icon and subscribe! Thanks and peace out!</p center>
