    <h1>Cheeseburger Meatloaf</h1>
    <img src="../images/meatloaf.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I have been craving meatloaf for weeks, but I wanted something a little ✨different✨. So, I decided to throw just a little spin on the classic and make this cheese studded Cheddar Cheeseburger Meatloaf. This meatloaf-cheeseburger hybrid is just as comforting as the kind mom used to make, but with a little more personality (hello, melty nuggets of cheddar!).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Meatloaf</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>4 ounces sharp cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF. In a small bowl stir together the breadcrumbs, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and salt. In a separate small bowl, lightly whisk the egg.</li>
        <li>Finely mince the onion. Roughly chop the cheddar cheese so that it is in pieces about the same size as a small bean.
        </li>
        <li>Add the ground beef, seasoned breadcrumbs, whisked egg, minced onion, and chopped cheddar to a bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Place the meat mixture in a casserole dish or on a rimmed baking sheet and shape into a rectangle, approximately 7" long, 4" wide, and 1.5" thick. </li>
        <li>To make the glaze, stir together the ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Spread the glaze over the unbaked meatloaf.</li>
        <li>Bake the meatloaf in the preheated oven for 50-55 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160ºF. Remove the meatloaf from the oven, let it sit for 5-10 minutes, then slice into eight pieces and serve.</li>
    </ol>
